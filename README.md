Temporarily set an Application environment value within a block, for when you
need to test behaviour that depends on Application environment values.

```elixir
TemporaryEnv.set :my_app, greeting: "Hello!" do
  # :greeting for :my_app is now "Hello!"
end
# :greeting for :my_app is back to its original value
```

This *does* modify global state, so do not use it in an async situation.

## Usage

Add it as a mix dependancy.

```elixir
# mix.exs
def deps do
  [
    {:temporary_env, github: "lpil/temporary-env", only: :test},
  ]
end
```

Install this new dependancy.

```
mix deps.get
```

Use it in your tests, but only in cases with async set to false.

```elixir
# test/some_example_test.exs
defmodule SomeExampleTest do
  use ExUnit, async: false
  use TemporaryEnv

  test "TemporaryEnv works" do
    TemporaryEnv.set :my_app, greeting: "Hello, world!" do
      value = Application.get_env :my_app, :greeting
      assert value == "Hello, world!"
    end
    value = Application.get_env :my_app, :greeting
    assert value == nil
  end
end
```
